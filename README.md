🚀  Drowsiness Detection
📖 Overview
This project is an image classifier designed to detect signs of drowsiness using two models: a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and a CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory). The app classifies images into one of the following categories:

😴 Yawn: The person is yawning.
😐 No Yawn: The person is not yawning.
👀 Open: The person’s eyes are open.
😌 Closed: The person’s eyes are closed.
The GUI for this application is built using Tkinter.

⚙️ Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/image-classifier-drowsiness.git
Install the dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dependencies include:

🧠 TensorFlow/Keras: For building and running neural networks.
📊 Numpy: For array manipulations.
🖼️ Pillow (PIL): For image processing.
🖱️ Tkinter: For GUI development (usually pre-installed with Python).
🛠️ Usage
Preprocess Images: Images are converted to grayscale, resized to 100x100 pixels, and normalized to [0, 1] pixel values using:

python
Copy code
img_array = np.array(img) / 255.0
Running the Classifier: Launch the app with:

bash
Copy code
python image_classifier.py
Using the GUI:

Click the "Select Image" button to choose an image from your file system.
The app will display the image and provide predictions from both the CNN and CNN-LSTM models.
🧠 Model Architecture
📊 CNN Model
Input: Grayscale image of size (100x100x1)
Architecture:
Conv2D with 32 filters (3x3 kernel) + ReLU activation
MaxPooling2D (2x2 pool size)
Conv2D with 64 filters (3x3 kernel) + ReLU activation
MaxPooling2D (2x2 pool size)
Flatten layer to convert 2D data into 1D
Dense layer with 128 units + ReLU activation
Dropout (50%) for regularization
Softmax output layer (4 units, one for each class)
📈 CNN-LSTM Model
Similar to the CNN model, but includes two LSTM layers after flattening the data, to capture temporal features (useful for sequential data).
📊 Training
Loss Function: sparse_categorical_crossentropy
Optimizer: Adam
Metrics: Accuracy
Training:
Dataset: Preprocessed grayscale images of size 100x100 pixels.
Data split: 80% training and 20% testing using train_test_split().
Model trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 64.
📈 Evaluation
Training Accuracy: Evaluated on training data after training.
Testing Accuracy: Evaluated on unseen test data using model.evaluate().
Example output:

Test Accuracy: 95.00%
💻 GUI Details
Tkinter GUI:
Displays the selected image in a 200x200 pixel window.
Shows predictions from both the CNN and CNN-LSTM models.
Key Functions:
preprocess_image():

Converts image to grayscale, resizes to 100x100, and normalizes.
Reshapes the image for the model: (100, 100, 1).
predict_cnn():

Takes the preprocessed image and runs a prediction using the CNN model.
Returns the predicted class label.
predict_cnn_lstm():

Runs prediction using the CNN-LSTM model.
Returns the predicted class label.
🚀 Future Enhancements
🕵️‍♂️ Real-time Detection: Implement real-time drowsiness detection from live video streams using the CNN-LSTM model.
💡 Data Augmentation: Improve generalization by adding more variations in lighting, angle, and noise to the dataset.
🎥 Sequential Image Input: Extend the CNN-LSTM model to handle video or continuous frame inputs for more accurate predictions.
